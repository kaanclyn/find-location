# find-location
It is a web application that shows your geographic location by entering your IP address. It uses Yandex Maps API and verifies your IP address.


In this project, I developed a web application that determines geographic location using an IP address. The application allows users to enter their IP addresses and view the location corresponding to these IP addresses on the map. I also show predefined coordinates corresponding to specific IP addresses.

You can also get the source codes of the project by clicking the "Download Source Code" button. You can further develop the codes and share them with me and your network. I would be happy to interact and communicate.

1. Technologies and APIs Used

I developed the project using the following technologies and APIs:

* HTML and CSS: I used to create the structure and style of the web page.
* JavaScriptâ€‹: I used for dynamic interactions and API calls.
* Yandex Maps API: I used to display locations on the map.
* IP-API: I used to get geographic location information corresponding to IP addresses.

2. Privacy and Security

I developed the project considering the principles of privacy and protection of personal rights. I deliberately made deviations in the calculations and concealed the real coordinates. However, my software developer friends can obtain the exact coordinates from the IP addresses by making the necessary changes and small mathematical calculations.
